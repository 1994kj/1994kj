Hi, I'm 1994kj, I'm new to coding,  but I already have  some basic knowledge in C++ and Python. Iâ€™m currently working on different projects. 
My goal is to create my own 2D game engine in either C/C++ or Python. I would much appreciate anyoneâ€™s advice in  either Python or C/C++ I hope to make  new friends and learn to code at the same time. ðŸ˜Š
